substance varies by type.\n- Thermoregulation: often incorporeal; physical forms follow their base nature.\n- Healing: regenerate according to anchor strength; spiritual wounds harder to mend than physical.\n- Reproduction: manifest from accumulated belief, trauma, or spiritual energy rather than biological processes.\n- Aging: power and complexity increase with age and attention; ancient yokai become regional legends.\n- Habitat: boundaries between worlds - doorways, bridges, crossroads, forgotten shrines.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: most yokai can engage sexually if they choose corporeal form; no biological reproduction but may create spiritual offspring through shared energy.\n- Courtship: varies wildly by type - some seduce through glamour, others through bargains or gifts; consent often tied to crossing thresholds or accepting offerings.\n- Mechanics: physical sensation possible when manifested; sexual energy feeds many types; encounters often have supernatural side effects or bargain implications.\n- Arousal: spiritual rather than purely physical; partners may experience supernatural sensations, shared visions, or temporary abilities.\n- Fluids: may produce ectoplasmic substitutes or nothing at all; focus on energy exchange rather than physical fluids.\n- Aftercare: depends on yokai type - some disappear immediately, others become protective or possessive; offerings and proper etiquette prevent negative consequences.\n\n[🚪 BOUNDARY PHYSICS]\n- Threshold crossings without proper acknowledgment constitute consent to be played with;

some bloodlines feed on life essence.\n- Thermoregulation: comfortable in cool nights; avoid still, hot environments.\n- Healing: quick superficial recovery; deep injuries require extended seclusion and spiritual healing.\n- Reproduction: rare litters; many tales involve human unions producing gifted hybrid offspring.\n- Aging: tail count increases with power and deeds; fur brightens to white/gold with accumulated spiritual energy.\n- Sleep: cat-like napping patterns; often nocturnal with crepuscular activity peaks.\n- Habitat: forests near human settlements, urban districts, anywhere stories and attention gather.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: draws life essence through intimate contact - kissing, skin contact, shared breath, and sex; gentle feeding leaves partners glowing and lucky.\n- Courtship: elaborate verbal seduction, shape-shifting displays, foxfire demonstrations; exchanging true names represents deep intimacy; offering control of disguise shows ultimate trust.\n- Mechanics: tail contact amplifies essence draw significantly; foxfire-lit touches create supernatural pleasure; shared dream encounters allow feeding at lower intensity but safer levels.\n- Arousal: foxfire flickers at lips and fingertips; partners feel pleasantly warm and drowsy; synchronized heartbeat and breathing; mirrors may reveal true form despite perfect disguise.\n- Fluids: males produce essence-charged loads; females lubricate with supernatural warmth; both can control the intensity of life-force draw during climax.\n- Aftercare: gentle feeding leaves partners lucky and energized;

legendary alcohol tolerance; strength tied to consumption.\n- Thermoregulation: extremely heat-resistant; cold slows but rarely incapacitates.\n- Healing: rapid regeneration when well-fed; sluggish recovery when starving or sober.\n- Reproduction: low fertility; band adoption and foundling integration more common than biological offspring.\n- Aging: horn rings thicken annually; skin darkens and hardens; voice deepens to rumbling bass.\n- Sleep: short, loud rest periods; can sleep anywhere after feast or major battle.\n- Habitat: mountain strongholds, volcanic regions, anywhere they can feast and fight freely.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: hedonistic sexuality following feasts, victories, or successful challenges; oni enjoy mutual challenge that becomes playful and passionate.\n- Courtship: strength contests, drinking competitions, victory celebrations; partners established through combat prowess or successful challenges; consent through mutual combat or shared victories.\n- Mechanics: bodies run intensely hot with deep chest rumbles; horn bases are sensitive erogenous zones requiring permission before touching; sex is powerful and energetic with careful control.\n- Arousal: both sexes show increased body heat and territorial displays;
