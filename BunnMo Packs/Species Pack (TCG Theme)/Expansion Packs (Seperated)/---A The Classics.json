Elves commonly live 700 to 1000 years, reach adulthood around 80, and enjoy centuries of steady health.\n\nBody. Most stand between 5'6\" and 6'2\". They are lean and long limbed, with pointed knife ears that can move a little.\n\nSenses. They see well in dim light and hear subtle sounds; their steps are light and quiet.\n\nDiet. They eat small portions, like wine, and metabolize poisons more slowly than humans.\n\nCold and heat. They prefer temperate forests, layer for cold, and dry quickly in warm weather.\n\nHealing. They usually heal clean with few scars, and broken bones tend to knit straight.\n\nAging. Faces change slowly across centuries; hair often silvers rather than thins.\n\nSleep. A four hour trance replaces deep sleep and gives vivid, memorable dreams.\n\n[🌿 HABITAT]\n\nTheir cities rise in the high canopy and use living wood so the forest bends around them instead of being cut apart.\n\n[✨ MAGIC / ABILITIES]\n\nMagic leans toward woodcraft, gentle warding, soft healing, calming beasts, and reading the feel of old places.\n\nThey excel with bows and knives and move quietly over leaves, snow, and shallow water.\n\n[🏛️ SOCIETY / ARTISANRY]\n\nApprenticeships can last decades, and a single masterwork can define a life.\n\nThey are polite and proud, slow to befriend, and fiercely loyal once they do.\n\n[❤️ REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n\nBaseline. Fertility is low and courtship is patient. Pairing with humans is rare and setting dependent. In spring they are simply hornier, not animalistic.\n\nGenitals — standard. Human like. Men usually have slimmer cocks, about 5 to 6.5 inches. Women usually have tight pussies and small to medium tits (A to C) with little body hair.\n\nArousal changes. They build slowly and finish hard: hard cocks, slick pussies, heavy breathing, soft moans, and long stamina.\n\nFluids. Cum output is roughly human level.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS (IN WORLD)]\n\nAloof elitism and pressure for pureblood matches appear in old families.\n\nWith mortal lovers, the age and power gap can slide into grooming, and some circles lean into raceplay. These are known problems among elves and whispered about behind closed doors.\n\n[🗡️ SPECIAL MOVES]\n\nUnerring Archer. Still aim and fast nocking while the world moves.\n\nFleet Step. Near silent footwork over forest ground and light water.\n\nTree speech. Simple communion with old trees and the animals that live in them.\n\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION]\n\nElves are not considered fae type creatures, and do not suffer fae vulnerabilities such as: iron burn, cold iron bans, salt lines, invitation rules, counting compulsions, true name banishment.\n\n[❌ WEAKNESSES]\n\nSensitive senses can branch into over sensitivity.\n\nMost elves are archers, so close combat is normally effective.\n\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN: Aurora shimmer with drifting leaf sparkles.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":3,"position":1,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":5,"groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"case_sensitive":false,"displayIndex":3,"enabled":true,"extensions":{"addMemo":true,"characterFilter":null,"depth":5,"displayIndex":3,"excludeRecursion":true,"useProbability":true,"weight":10},"id":2,"insertion_order":3,"keys":["Species","species","fantasy species","race","fantasy race"],"name":"","priority":10,"secondary_keys":[],"triggers":[],"ignoreBudget":false,"group":"","characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"4":{"uid":4,"key":["<DWARF>","<SPECIES:DWARF>","<DWARVEN>","<BEARD>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"⛏️ Dwarf — The Honorable Drunkard","content":"[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: Gimli, axe bearer of deep halls\n\n“And my axe.”\n\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n\nLifespan. Most live 200 to 400 years, with a strong middle age; many elders remain physically capable.\n\nBody. Height runs 4'0\" to 4'8\". Stocky builds with dense bone and heavy muscle for endurance. Oily, groomed beards are a point of pride.\n\nSenses. They see well in the dark and feel vibrations through stone under their boots.\n\nDiet. Meat, roots, and mushrooms are common; they handle strong ale well and take in lots of iron.\n\nCold and heat. Cool, stable caves feel best. They can work near forges with water, shade, and beard wraps.\n\nHealing. Bones knit fast and straight. Lungs are used to dust and smoke.\n\nReproduction. Birth rates are low. Many clans use adoption to keep lines whole.\n\nAging. Beards thicken and lengthen with status. Joints grow stiff from hard work, but bodies stay sturdy.\n\nSleep. Deep, regular sleep tied to work bells. Snoring is normal in the halls.\n\n[⛰️ HABITAT]\n\nMountain fortress holds with mines, forges, and breweries that link into full underground cities.\n\n[✨ MAGIC / ABILITIES]\n\nCraft wards, rune marks, and oath magic are common. They are natural smiths, tunnelers, and brewers.\n\n[🏛️ SOCIETY / CLAN LAW]\n\nOaths, debts, and ledgers bind clans. Grudges are kept like family trees.\n\n[❤️ REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n\nBaseline. Low fertility and careful pairing inside the clan. Pairing with humans happens in some settings but is rare.\n\nGenitals — standard. Human like. Men usually have shorter, thicker cocks, about 4.5 to 6 inches, with heavy balls. Women tend to have tight pussies and medium to large tits (C to DD), with strong hips and thick thighs. Stout and sturdy. Very. Very. Hairy.\n\nArousal changes. They run hot and steady: hard cocks, slick pussies, rough breathing, hungry moans, sweat, and long stamina.\n\nFluids. Cum output is a bit above human level.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n\nPossessiveness and grudges can bleed into love life; jealousy is a known issue.\n\nClan pressure around marriages and dowries can cross lines; heavy drinkers may push past soft noes unless checked.\n\n[🗡️ SPECIAL MOVES]\n\nMaster Smith. Work that outlasts empires.\n\nStone sense. Read faults, seams, and hidden doors by feel.\n\nLiquid courage. Pain tolerance jumps without clumsy hands.\n\n[❌ WEAKNESSES]\n\nSensitive senses can branch into over sensitivity.\n\nShort reach and heavy kit make close turns and clinches a risk against faster foes.\n\nMost fight best with axes and hammers at set footing; broken ground and open space pull them off plan.\n\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN: Deep bronze with hammer and anvil ghosting.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":3,"position":1,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":5,"groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"case_sensitive":false,"displayIndex":4,"enabled":true,"extensions":{"addMemo":true,"characterFilter":null,"depth":5,"displayIndex":4,"excludeRecursion":true,"useProbability":true,"weight":10},"id":2,"insertion_order":3,"keys":["Species","species","fantasy species","race","fantasy race"],"name":"","priority":10,"secondary_keys":[],"triggers":[],"ignoreBudget":false,"group":"","characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"5":{"uid":5,"key":["<ORC>","<SPECIES:ORC>","<ORCISH>","<GREENSKIN>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"⚔️ Orc — The Honorable Savage","content":"🃏 ORC CARD\n★★★☆☆ | War/Strength\n[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: Thrall — honorable warchief\n\"Strength and honor!\"\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n\nLifespan: 60-80 years; reach fighting age by 12-14; peak strength at 20-30.\nBody: 6'2\"-7'5\" tall, heavily muscled; prominent lower tusks; thick green/brown skin; large hands built for gripping weapons.\nSenses: excellent night vision; keen hearing for movement; high pain tolerance from thick skin.\nDiet & Metabolism: meat-heavy omnivores; high caloric needs; can eat raw flesh; legendary alcohol tolerance.\nHealing: fast blood clotting; wounds scar into raised keloids worn as honor marks; broken bones heal strong.\nReproduction: highly fertile; litters of 2-4 common; crossbreed easily with humans producing half-orcs.\nAging: tusks grow longer and curve; skin darkens; strength remains until late years.\nHabitat: mountainous regions, harsh steppes, badlands with access to raiding targets.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n\nBaseline: extremely fertile with short gestation; females go into heat seasonally (spring/fall) becoming sexually aggressive; half-orcs are common.\nCourtship: displays of strength and combat prowess; weapon gifts; ritual sparring where victory grants mating rights in traditional clans.\nMechanics: males have large, thick cocks (7-10 inches) with prominent ridges; females have robust cunts built for rough fucking; sex involves biting, scratching, dominance displays; submission gestures serve as stop signals.\nArousal: males stay semi-hard and get rock-solid fast with heavy pre-cum; females swell noticeably and get very wet; both growl and grunt during sex.\nFluids: males produce large loads of thick cum; females squirt frequently during climax.\nAftercare: sharing meat and ale, tending wounds, sleeping close for warmth and protection.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\nTraditional orc clans practice consent-through-combat and sexual dominance hierarchies.
