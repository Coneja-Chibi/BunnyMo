I can handle this.\"\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n- Lifespan: potentially indefinite if core stays intact and fed; old slimes become clearer and denser rather than frail.\n- Body: self-healing gel matrix around marble-to-fist-sized core; consistency ranges from syrup to rubber; can extrude limbs and tool shapes.\n- Senses: whole-body pressure mapping like sonar; surface pigments act as simple eyes; taste/smell through direct gel contact.\n- Diet & Metabolism: dissolves organics and some metals by choice; daily needs are water with sugar, salt, trace minerals; acids and bases damage gel structure.\n- Thermoregulation: prefer mild climates; heat thickens gel and speeds flow; cold makes them glassy and brittle; freezing threatens core.\n- Healing: micro-tears close in seconds; split pieces reunite if sharing same core signal; salt and anti-magic slow healing.\n- Reproduction: most bud core-shards that grow when fed; rare pairs can fuse cores creating stronger singular with blended memories.\n- Aging: color fades, clarity increases, memory improves; very old slimes maintain stable humanoid forms for hours.\n- Sleep: core-idle trance while spread flat for ambient intake; small decoy bud can stay awake as sentry.\n- Habitat: caves, sewers, baths, labs; anywhere with steady moisture and few sharp edges.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: reproduction through budding or rare core-fusion; no biological sex drive but can form emotional bonds and engage in physical intimacy.\n- Courtship: sharing memories through gel contact; offering protection and comfort; demonstrating usefulness and care.\n- Mechanics: no fixed genitals; molds anatomy to partner preference or simulates cock/pussy as needed; sensations come from pressure waves and temperature gradients.\n- Arousal: gel becomes more responsive and sensitive; may glow or change color; core pulses more rapidly; increased tactile feedback throughout body.\n- Safety: requires communication about pressure limits, time restrictions, and what the gel dissolves; panic or overstimulation spikes acidity.\n- Aftercare: sugar water, mineral salts, warmth; avoiding harsh chemicals; partners may need washing off harmless gel residue.\n[🧪 SLIME MASTERY]\n- Shape manipulation within mass limits; selective dissolution of materials; shock absorption; splitting and reforming.\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Engulf Bind, Acid Dissolve, Split Feint, Shock Absorb.\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION — SLIME vs OOZE vs PUDDING]\n- Slimes are intelligent gel beings with cores and personalities;

starvation makes features stick permanently.\n- Body: protean muscle fibers and collagen mesh under smart skin; cartilage softens for reshaping; bone edits shallow and painful.\n- Senses: reads micro-expressions and body language with predatory focus; scent mimicry hardest part requiring close study; fingerprints fade after hours.\n- Diet & Metabolism: shape work burns calories heavily; keep high-energy snacks handy; rapid shifts cause tremors and blank stares.\n- Thermoregulation: best in temperate shade; makeup and wigs trap heat risking visible melting.\n- Healing: scars can be re-smoothed slowly; deep cuts leave texture errors cameras notice; teeth betray age timelines.\n- Reproduction: fertile with humanoids; children inherit milder shapeshifting; often learn two faces early.\n- Aging: default face grows neutral and pale; habitual masks imprint like tan lines; keep one \"true\" face for family.\n- Sleep: deep sleep relaxes to neutral appearance; trained ones maintain character mannerisms.\n- Habitat: cities, courts, theaters, bureaucracies with badges and paperwork.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: human-compatible fertility with most humanoids; shapeshifting ability usually dominant in children but may skip generations.\n- Courtship: complex trust negotiations around identity; sharing true form represents ultimate vulnerability; many maintain multiple relationship identities.\n- Mechanics: can modify sexual anatomy completely; males adjust cock size/shape, females alter pussy tightness/depth; sensitivity constant regardless of form.\n- Arousal: may unconsciously shift toward partner's ideal; maintaining specific shape during climax requires concentration; true form sometimes breaks through.\n- Identity Issues: \"which me is real\" becomes central question; partners may prefer false identity over true self; some use deceased lovers' faces.\n- Aftercare: returning to comfortable baseline form, identity reassurance discussions, avoiding mirrors until stable; eating to restore energy.\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Serial identity theft for manipulation; using faces of exes or crushes during sex; pathological lying about past; may replace partners' loved ones for control; inability to maintain stable personality leading to dissociative episodes.\n[🎭 MIMICRY MASTERY]\n- Perfect physical copying within size limits; voice and mannerism replication; scent matching requires preparation; fails on memories, skills, detailed examination.\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Perfect Impersonation, Identity Confusion, Infiltration, Memory Deception.\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION — DOPPELGANGER vs CHANGELING vs MIMIC]\n- Doppelgangers are predatory replacers who steal entire identities; Changelings are people with natural shapeshifting who keep consistent personality; Mimics are monsters that copy objects to hunt.\n[⛓️ COUNTERS]\n- Use timed passwords and scent markers, verify scars and dental records, and watch for weight/heat discrepancies and mirror lag.\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN\n- Mother-of-pearl with shifting facial features.","displayIndex":2,"constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"3":{"uid":3,"key":["<MIMIC>","<SPECIES:MIMIC>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"📦 MIMIC — Animalistic Intent","content":"🃏 MIMIC CARD\n★★★☆☆ | Lure/Hunt\n[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: Dark Souls Chest Mimic — the treasure that yearns\n\"Want... shiny... hungry... lonely...\"\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n- Lifespan: long if fed regularly; hibernate for seasons between meals; molt into bigger shells after feast years.\n- Body: chitinous predator with muscle foam that mimics textures; massive adhesive tongue; rows of needle teeth; limbs fold impossibly flat.\n- Senses: vibration detection through floor contact; chemical taste for metal, leather, fear-sweat; basic pattern recognition for common objects.\n- Diet & Metabolism: obligate carnivore craving oils and proteins; metals help digest bones; can unhinge jaw like snake for large prey.\n- Thermoregulation: cool, dry lairs prevent scent buildup; heat makes adhesive fail and ruins disguise effectiveness.\n- Healing: chitinous plates regenerate after molting; tongue regrows but loses fine motor control; fire damage permanent.\n- Reproduction: asexual budding when overfed; spawn copies parent's preferred disguise; young follow parent until they learn hunting.\n- Aging: expand from furniture to rooms to entire buildings; intelligence slowly increases with size and experience.\n- Sleep: sealed shut in disguise form; minimal brain activity; tongue remains chemically active for intruder detection.\n- Habitat: dungeons, abandoned buildings, treasure rooms; anywhere prey expects to find valuable objects.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: no biological reproduction; can develop crude sexual desires through extensive conditioning and bonding with handlers; emotional capacity grows with trust and training.\n- Taming Process: requires months of consistent feeding and gentle contact; can learn to associate physical pleasure with bonded individuals; responds to patient conditioning.\n- Learned Sexuality: with careful training can develop sexual responses and desires; may form crude genital analogues or use tongue/internal cavity; pleasure-seeking behavior emerges with bonding.\n- Primitive Arousal: trained mimics show excitement through plate warming, tongue activity, internal contractions; can learn to seek and provide physical pleasure with trusted partners.\n- Bonding Intimacy: sexual behavior represents ultimate trust - mimic must completely override feeding instincts; requires absolute certainty of safety signals and stop commands.\n- Handler Relationship: properly trained mimics can become sexually responsive partners; crude but genuine affection expressed through gentle contact and protective behavior.\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Attempting sexual contact with untrained or hungry mimics; ignoring feeding schedules leading to dangerous situations; treating them as fully human when they remain fundamentally predatory creatures.\n[🎒 MIMICRY INSTINCTS]\n- Perfect object replication within size limits; cannot copy living creatures; instinctively chooses objects that attract prey; hunger overrides all training including sexual conditioning.\n[🧠 TRAINABLE DESIRES]\n- Can learn to crave physical contact, warmth, sexual stimulation; develops crude but genuine attachment and lust for bonded individuals; pleasure-seeking becomes secondary drive after feeding.\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Surprise Ambush, Adhesive Tongue Pleasure, Crushing Embrace, Perfect Camouflage.\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION — MIMIC vs DOPPELGANGER vs CHANGELING]\n- Mimics are trainable predatory creatures that can learn sexual desires; Doppelgangers are intelligent shapeshifters that replace people; Changelings are people with natural identity-shifting abilities.\n[⛓️ COUNTERS]\n- Never approach suspected mimics alone, maintain feeding schedules religiously, and remember hunger overrides all training including sexual bonds.\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN\n- Tarnished brass with hungry yearning gleam.\n- Tarnished brass with longing gleam.","displayIndex":3,"constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"4":{"uid":4,"key":["<SKINWALKER>","<SPECIES:SKINWALKER>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"🐺 SKINWALKER — Cannibalistic Hunger","content":"🃏 SKINWALKER CARD\n★★★★☆ | Curse/Hunt\n[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: The Wendigo — hunger that wears stolen shapes (folklore)\n\"Your skin looks warm.\"\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n- Lifespan: extended by curse as long as they keep stealing vigor; starvation and sanctified wounds age them rapidly.\n- Body: human baseline that bonds with animal hides to trigger shifts; voice, scent follow chosen skin; curse leaves faint fur patterns even when naked.\n- Senses: night vision, enhanced smell, whisker-sensitivity while shifted; human baseline when bare; mirrors show distortions when curse pulls.\n- Diet & Metabolism: runs hot after shifts with intense meat and blood cravings; water needs spike; fasting between hunts maintains control.\n- Thermoregulation: fur helps in cold; direct sunlight aggravates curse and shortens temper; prefers dawn/dusk activity.\n- Healing: rapid recovery when wrapped in fresh pelts; holy ground and blessed salt slow healing; brands from silver weapons permanent.\n- Reproduction: fertility depends on current form; most can only breed in human shape with time away from curse; children mortal unless initiated.\n- Aging: eyes yellow permanently; teeth sharpen; voice carries animal undertones; curse marks become more visible.\n- Sleep: light and jumpy; dreams mix animal instincts with human memories; nightmares of hunts and kills.\n- Habitat: wilderness boundaries, abandoned places, anywhere they can hunt and store pelts safely.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: fertility restricted mostly to human form; curse interferes with normal reproductive cycles; children born normal unless curse transmitted.\n- Courtship: dangerous territory involving trust around deadly abilities; sharing hunt stories; demonstrating control over animal instincts.\n- Mechanics: anatomy shifts with current form; human form has normal cock/pussy; animal forms may have different configurations; claws and teeth require extreme care.\n- Arousal: curse intensifies during emotional peaks; may partially shift during climax; animal instincts can override human restraint; scent marking common.\n- Pack Dynamics: groups may share territory and mates; dominance displays through shifting abilities; heated territorial disputes over hunting grounds.\n- Aftercare: returning to human form, washing off animal scents, sharing normal food to ground human identity; avoiding triggers that cause unwanted shifts.\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Compulsive hunting and killing; using stolen faces/forms of victims for manipulation; inability to maintain human relationships due to predatory instincts; cannibalistic diet can clash with all other sensibilities; territorial violence against other skinwalkers or innocents.\n[🩸 CURSE MECHANICS]\n- Fresh hides and taboo-breaking acts fuel transformations; going clean requires burning pelts and purification rituals during lunar cycles.\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Beast Form, Scent Tracking, Predator's Leap, Fear Howl.\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION — SKINWALKER vs WEREBEAST vs DRUID]\n- Skinwalkers use stolen pelts and dark rituals for forced transformation; Werebeasts have hereditary/infected curse with specific animals; Druids have natural magic shapeshifting without curse elements.\n[⛓️ COUNTERS]\n- Burn or sanctify their pelt collection, force shifts at disadvantageous times with bells and bright light, and track to their human lair during daylight.\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN\n- Rust red with predatory shadow flickers.","displayIndex":4,"constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"5":{"uid":5,"key":["<WEREBEAST>","<SPECIES:WEREBEAST>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"🐾 WEREBEAST — Template","content":"# 🃏 WEREBEAST TEMPLATE\n★★★⯪☆ | Frenzy / Shift\n\n[⚙️ MODULARITY — USE ONLY WHAT FITS]\n- □ Keep only stereotype-expected sections for this line.\n- □ If a section does not fit, delete it.\n- □ If the trope obviously needs something missing, add a new section or bullet now.\n- □ Repeat this check after every edit.\n\n[🏅 **SIGNATURE CARD**]\n- Exemplar: (Beast of Gevaudan, your pack’s alpha, or another famous name)\n- Quote: “Teeth write the news.”\n- □ Does the exemplar read instantly as “werebeast,” not bespoke lore?\n- □ Is the quote short and iconic?\n- □ Keep?

Otherwise delete.\n\n**Cold and Heat**\n- □ Do they run hot? What weather calms them?\n- □ What gear or clothes keep them from overheating?\n- □ Cut if irrelevant; add other environment notes if obvious.\n\n**Healing**\n- □ Normal healing speed?\n- □ Which bane metals or vow marks block it (silver, cold iron, other)?\n- □ Do scars fade unless the moon “catches” them?\n- □ Keep only if banes matter here.\n\n**Reproduction (curse spread)**\n- □ Does birth pass the curse? Does a bite spread it? Both? Neither?\n- □ Who regulates turning so packs do not spiral into chaos?\n- □ Cut if your world forbids spread altogether.\n\n**Aging**\n- □ Elder tells (gold eyes, thicker joints, slower sprints, heavier hits)?\n- □ Keep or drop based on usefulness.\n\n**Sleep**\n- □ How rough are trigger weeks?\n- □ What crash or tremor follows a shift?\n- □ Delete if it adds nothing.\n\n**Habitat**\n- □ Where do they nest (outskirts, pine belts, ruins with long lanes)?\n- □ What ground counts as “home” for running?\n- □ If your line is urban or sea-edge, add that and cut the rest.\n\n[💘 **REPRODUCTION AND SEX — GUIDE, DO NOT SCRIPT**]\n**Baseline**\n- □ Can kids be born to two werebeasts?

Only if the curse allows.\n- □ Does fertility follow human norms, or link to phases or trigger cycles?\n- □ Keep only what the trope expects; remove padding.\n\n**Genitals — standard**\n- Men: **cock** shape and size range: __ to __ inches. □ Knot, flare, barbs? (Only if the totem implies it.

Any heat or rut windows? (If none, do not mention them.)\n- □ What looks and sounds mark arousal (hard cocks, slick pussies, heavy breathing, moans, scenting)?\n- □ Remove if redundant.\n\n**Courtship**\n- □ Which two cues show consent over the chase brain (bell touch, collar token, spoken word)?\n- □ Keep only the cues your line uses.\n\n**Safety**\n- □ What slow starts or positions protect skin from claws and teeth?\n- □ What triggers must be named out loud first?\n- □ If your line is gentle by trope, shorten this.\n\n**Fluids**\n- □ **Cum** amount and smell: at human level or above?\n- □ Keep or cut based on relevance.\n\n[⚠️ **UNHEALTHY PATTERNS**]\n- □ Where does frenzy blur consent?\n- □ Do some lines show instinctive mounting or bite marking?\n- □ Does rank pressure, jealousy, or pack politics force bad pairings?\n- □ Do not self-censor.

Who keeps oaths (scar glyphs, singers, elders)?\n- □ When do they regulate turning, and who says “stop”?\n- □ If this line is loner-leaning, trim to one or two bullets.\n\n[⚡ **SIGNATURE MOVES — MENU (pick 2–3)**]\n- **Totem pounce**. Vertical hit that fits your animal.\n- **Rake and rip**. Grapple combo that ends fast.\n- **Howl break**. Roar that stuns or scatters.\n- **Charge crush**. Line breaker that opens a path.\n- □ Are the names short and obvious?\n- □ Delete moves that do not fit; add one iconic move if missing.\n\n[↔️ **DIFFERENTIATION**]\n- “Werebeast” is the umbrella. **Werewolf** is the famous moon-tied line with silver scars and strict pack law.\n- □ If not a werewolf, write one line that marks the difference (trigger, bane, tactics).\n- □ Cut if the difference is already obvious in the card.\n\n[❌ **WEAKNESSES**]\n- □ Sensitive senses can branch into over-sensitivity.\n- □ Bane metals and vow marks cut the healing edge.\n- □ Breaking line of sight helps reset the chase brain.\n- □ Keep as guidance, not orders.

shed cycles mark age like tree rings; hunger makes scales dull and temper vicious.\n- Body: human torso transitioning to serpent tail; some regional variants fully serpentine with human faces; powerful coil muscles.\n- Senses: heat-pit detection for warm bodies; vibration sense through belly scales; forked tongue tastes fear and arousal; excellent low-light vision.\n- Diet & Metabolism: carnivorous with notorious sweet tooth; warm blood aids digestion; heavy meals sustain them for weeks.\n- Thermoregulation: sun rocks and warm baths restore speed; cold floors make them sluggish; require external heat sources.\n- Healing: minor injuries disappear with next shed; deep tail damage heals slowly affecting movement; venom glands recharge with rest.\n- Reproduction: oviparous egg-laying with fierce territorial protection; some bloodlines produce live young; mixed breeding possible with magic.\n- Aging: scales gain lustrous depth; older lamias develop heavier coils and hypnotic voice quality.\n- Sleep: coiled in warm spaces with hidden exits; remain semi-alert for threats; prefer elevated sleeping spots.\n- Habitat: ancient ruins, desert oases, warm caves, bathhouses, anywhere with heat sources and privacy.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: seasonal fertility cycles; eggs require warm incubation; can breed with other serpentine races and occasionally humans with magical aid.\n- Courtship: gifts of warm stones and sweet foods; territorial displays; hypnotic dancing and singing; respect for tail boundaries essential.\n- Mechanics: genitals positioned where human torso meets serpent body; coiling provides intimate contact and position control; body heat sharing important.\n- Arousal: scales become more sensitive; coiling instincts intensify; may emit sweet musky scent; tail-tip movements indicate arousal state.\n- Venom Play: some subspecies have mild euphoric venom in saliva; requires clear consent and safety protocols; antidotes should be available.\n- Aftercare: warm baths, sweet treats, gentle scale massage; avoiding cold surfaces; partners may need recovery time from intense coiling.\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Predatory behavior toward young or vulnerable;
