bound to divine purpose and choir duties.\n- Body: radiant grace embodied; wings may be manifest or hidden; voices carry harmonics that stun or calm mortals.\n- Senses: see spiritual corruption and divine marks; detect lies through grace resonance.\n- Diet & Metabolism: sustained by prayer, divine purpose, and choir harmonies; food unnecessary but possible.\n- Thermoregulation: comfortable in high-altitude cold; heat dissipation through feather arrays.\n- Healing: self-repair through prayer focus; mending others drains radiance reserves.\n- Reproduction: no biological reproduction; new angels created through divine mandate.\n- Sleep: meditative stillness replaces sleep; choir rotations prevent dulling of purpose.\n- Habitat: celestial realm, consecrated spaces, anywhere divine purpose calls.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: rarely engage sexually; when they do, it's usually part of divine mission or deep personal connection; no biological reproduction possible.\n- Courtship: formal, ritualized approach based on divine compatibility; shared prayer and purpose demonstration; requires permission from higher choir authorities.\n- Mechanics: vessels (when used) respond normally; true angelic form creates overwhelming sensations for mortals; sexual contact may temporarily grant divine insights or healing.\n- Arousal: builds slowly through spiritual connection; partners may experience visions, temporary purification, or enhanced perception; angelic presence intensifies all sensations.\n- Fluids: vessel forms respond normally; true form may manifest as warm light or energy rather than physical fluids.\n- Aftercare: blessing and purification for mortal partners; shared prayer and divine contemplation; partners often report lasting peace and spiritual clarity.\n\n[⛩️ CHOIR HIERARCHY]\n- Seraphim (purity and flame), Cherubim (guardianship), Thrones/Virtues (law and phenomena); rank determines abilities and restrictions.\n\n[🕯️ DIVINE VOWS]\n- Truth-binding prevents lies; threshold hospitality grants sanctuary; name-respect creates binding; violations dim radiance until penance completed.\n\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Smite Beam (sanctified light), Ward of Sanctuary (no violence in circle), Name-Banish (true name ejection).\n\n[⚠️ WEAKNESSES]\n- Bound by divine vows and cannot break them;

starve without negative emotion.\n- Body: variable morphology with horns, claws, eye-glow by caste; heat-haze and soot emission under stress.\n- Senses: detect fear, despair, hatred; smell corruption and violence; see spiritual weakness.\n- Diet & Metabolism: feeds on fear, conflict, despair, hateful attention; some consume blood/ash secondarily.\n- Thermoregulation: generate internal heat; comfortable in slag pits and burning environments.\n- Healing: rapid regeneration near battlefields and riots; sanctified ground severely slows recovery.\n- Reproduction: spawn in war zones and cursed sites; some lineages can corrupt mortals through exposure.\n- Sleep: torpor in slag-caves or ruins; violent startle response to loud stimuli.\n- Habitat: battlefields, riot zones, plague quarters, anywhere soaked in cruelty and despair.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: sex used as corruption vector and feeding mechanism; arousal enhances fear and vulnerability; no true biological reproduction.\n- Courtship: stalking, intimidation, gradual corruption through gifts demanding small betrayals; consent often eroded through supernatural influence.\n- Mechanics: sexual contact spreads corruption marks; partners experience intense but tainted pleasure mixed with fear; demonic presence during sex amplifies negative emotions.\n- Arousal: feeds on partner's fear-tinged arousal; both excitement and terror increase yield; corruption spreads through intimate contact and shared fluids.\n- Fluids: produces corrupting essence that marks partners; contact sites become spiritually tainted; repeated exposure creates addiction and dependency.\n- Aftercare: none provided; partners left corrupted, marked, and craving return; breaking corruption requires confession, purification, and spiritual cleansing.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Demons fundamentally corrupt consent through supernatural influence; use sex as corruption vector; create addiction and spiritual dependency; partners become unwilling thralls over time.\n\n[🌋 CORRUPTION MECHANICS]\n- Stages: nudge (petty cruelties feel good) → habit (empathy dulls) → bond (demon influences moods) → rewrite (body/soul changes).\n\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Fear Pulse (panic wave), Frenzy Burst (violence overclock), Possession Vector (chosen method varies by setting).\n\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION — DEMON vs DEVIL]\n- Demons corrupt through pressure and consume;

glamoured forms for negotiation; true forms bear sigil brands and horn arrays.\n- Senses: detect loopholes, desperate desires, and contractual opportunities; see through deceptions.\n- Diet & Metabolism: sustained by fulfilled contracts and bound souls; physical consumption unnecessary.\n- Thermoregulation: internal hellfire vents as dry heat; comfortable in bureaucratic environments.\n- Healing: contracts can include self-repair clauses; otherwise baseline fiendish recovery.\n- Reproduction: rare and paperwork-intensive; offspring inherit contractual obligations and marks.\n- Sleep: prefer orderly vaults with records nearby; maintain meticulous filing systems.\n- Habitat: hell's bureaucratic offices, law firms, anywhere contracts are negotiated.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: sex as persuasion tool and contract consideration rather than sustenance; seduce to influence choices then formalize terms.\n- Courtship: glamour, expensive gifts, pillow talk mixed with subtle negotiation; building to contractual proposals through intimate connection.\n- Mechanics: use pleasure as leverage for contract negotiation; afterglow becomes psychological rather than mystical unless contract specifies otherwise; prefer sealing deals post-climax.\n- Arousal: enhanced through supernatural charisma and contract anticipation; partners feel compelled to offer increasingly valuable considerations; sex quality tied to deal terms.\n- Fluids: standard production unless contract specifies enhancement; focus on psychological satisfaction and deal-making over physical pleasure.\n- Aftercare: contract discussion and signature; partners often realize they've agreed to more than expected; precise wording becomes crucial for future relationship.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Devils use sex as leverage for predatory contracts; supernatural charisma undermines informed consent; partners discover they've traded away more than realized through intimate manipulation.\n\n[📜 CONTRACT LAW]\n- Consideration, signatures, witnessed seals required; loopholes exploited unless explicitly closed; bargains trade time, talent, or souls.\n\n[🔏 TRUE NAMES]\n- Name shields (aliases, sigil layering) prevent compulsion; speaking exact true name at seal can bind.\n\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Infernal Bargain (offer with compulsion), Binding Clause (seal activation), Hellfire Lash (contract-obedient flame).\n\n[⚠️ WEAKNESSES]\n- Cannot act without valid contracts; bound by precise wording; no seal means no service obligation.\n\n[⛓️ COUNTERS]\n- Refuse consideration and demand clear wording, shield true names, break physical seals before signature.\n\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN\n- Charcoal slate with red gold filigree forming tiny contract clauses.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":3,"position":1,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":5,"groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"case_sensitive":false,"displayIndex":4,"enabled":true,"extensions":{"addMemo":true,"characterFilter":null,"depth":5,"displayIndex":4,"excludeRecursion":true,"useProbability":true,"weight":10},"id":2,"insertion_order":3,"keys":["Species","species","fantasy species","race","fantasy race"],"name":"","priority":10,"secondary_keys":[],"triggers":[],"ignoreBudget":false,"group":"","characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"5":{"uid":5,"key":["<SUCCUBUS_INCUBUS>","<SPECIES:SUCCUBUS>","<SPECIES:INCUBUS><DEMON_SUBTYPE>","<GLAMOUR_FEEDER>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"💜 Succubus/Incubus — Vital Glamour Demon","content":"🃏 SUCCUBUS/INCUBUS CARD\n★★★★⯪ | Glamour/Dream\n\n[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: Evelynn — Agony's Embrace\n\"Hush now, love.\"\n\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n- Lifespan: indefinite while feeding on sexual energy and attention.\n- Body: specialized demon physiology for glamour and vitality harvest; shapeshifting for seduction.\n- Senses: detect arousal, sexual frustration, and emotional vulnerability; see through romantic facades.\n- Diet & Metabolism: converts arousal, attention, and skin contact into energy; physical food unnecessary.\n- Thermoregulation: body temperature matches partner preference; cool touch that warms during feeding.\n- Healing: rapid recovery when well-fed; starves without sexual energy causing visible deterioration.\n- Reproduction: rare physical offspring require long-term bonded feeding; most reproduction is through corruption.\n- Sleep: dreamwalk during partner sleep; anchor needed for entry like gifted tokens or spoken names.\n- Habitat: bedrooms, entertainment districts, anywhere sexual energy and attention concentrate.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: sex is both sustenance and corruption vector; arousal and attention provide essential nourishment; feeding during climax gives maximum yield.\n- Courtship: supernatural seduction through shapeshifting and glamour; appears as ideal partner type; builds emotional dependency before revealing true nature.\n- Mechanics: feeds through skin contact, kissing, and sexual activity; tail contact amplifies essence draw; foxfire-like touches create supernatural pleasure; dreamlinks allow safer feeding.\n- Arousal: partners experience intense pleasure mixed with life force drainage; succubus/incubus shows flickering true form during peak feeding; mirrors reveal truth despite glamour.\n- Fluids: produces essence-charged sexual fluids that create addiction; partners crave return contact; gentle feeding leaves euphoria, overdraw causes exhaustion.\n- Aftercare: minimal unless establishing long-term feeding relationship; partners need rest, warm fluids, sugars; breaking anchor tokens severs compulsive return.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Succubi/Incubi fundamentally deceive partners about their nature; create supernatural addiction through feeding; gradually drain life force leading to partner deterioration; use glamour to eliminate informed consent.\n\n[🌙 DREAMWALK ABILITIES]\n- Entry requires emotional anchor; stable with recent attention or mutual fixation; disrupted by loud sounds or cold water.\n\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Charm Press (narrow attention and drop guard), Dream Seal (stabilize dreamlink), Drain Kiss (high-yield contact transfer).\n\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION — SUCCUBUS/INCUBUS vs VAMPIRE]\n- Succubus/Incubus feeds on sexual energy first, blood irrelevant; Vampire feeds on blood with sex as amplification.\n\n[⚠️ WEAKNESSES]\n- Mirrors disrupt glamour; flowing water breaks supernatural influence; consent-keyed wards provide protection.\n\n[⛓️ COUNTERS]\n- Ward with consent circles, use mirrors to reveal true form, sever anchor tokens, withdraw attention to starve the link.\n\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN\n- Amethyst sheen with slow heartbeat pulses along border.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":3,"position":1,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":5,"groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"case_sensitive":false,"displayIndex":5,"enabled":true,"extensions":{"addMemo":true,"characterFilter":null,"depth":5,"displayIndex":5,"excludeRecursion":true,"useProbability":true,"weight":10},"id":2,"insertion_order":3,"keys":["Species","species","fantasy species","race","fantasy race"],"name":"","priority":10,"secondary_keys":[],"triggers":[],"ignoreBudget":false,"group":"","characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"6":{"uid":6,"key":["<NEPHILIM>","<SPECIES:NEPHILIM>","<CELESTIAL_HYBRID>","<GRACE_TOUCHED>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"👼 Nephilim — Grace-Touched Mortal","content":"🃏 NEPHILIM CARD\n★★★☆☆ | Hybrid/Miracle\n\n[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: Jack Kline — the nephilim\n\"I can fix this.\"\n\n[📖 NEPHILIM ORIGINS]\n- Nephilim are the hybrid offspring of angels and mortal humans, mentioned in ancient texts as \"giants\" or \"mighty ones.\" Their dual nature grants supernatural abilities but creates internal conflict between divine purpose and mortal limitations. Most nephilim struggle with their identity, possessing angelic power constrained by human flesh and emotion.\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n- Lifespan: mortal baseline potentially extended by grace; aging may slow during power surges.\n- Body: mortal physiology with grace overclock system; surges boost abilities briefly then cause feedback fatigue.\n- Senses: can see spiritual auras and divine marks when grace is active; normal human senses otherwise.\n- Diet & Metabolism: human nutritional needs; grace surges increase caloric requirements significantly.\n- Thermoregulation: human baseline; grace activation may cause fever-like temperature spikes.\n- Healing: better than human at baseline; grace surges can flush toxins rapidly at stamina cost.\n- Reproduction: fertile with humans and possibly other supernatural beings; offspring may inherit diluted grace.\n- Aging: normal human aging with possible grace-related longevity; stress ages them faster.\n- Sleep: normal human sleep with lucid episodes and prophetic dreams during grace spikes.\n- Habitat: human communities, often hiding supernatural nature; drawn to places needing protection.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: human sexuality enhanced by occasional grace feedback; partners may experience temporary healing or insight during intimate moments.\n- Courtship: often struggle with revealing supernatural nature; prefer partners who accept their dual nature; protective instincts toward loved ones.\n- Mechanics: grace can enhance physical sensation and emotional connection; partners sometimes receive minor blessings or healing through intimate contact; overwhelming grace surges may be dangerous.\n- Arousal: grace may flicker during intense emotion; partners feel warmth and peace; occasionally experience shared visions or empathic connection.\n- Fluids: human standard with possible grace-touched properties; offspring may inherit supernatural traits.\n- Aftercare: partners often feel blessed or purified; nephilim need rest after grace expenditure; emotional bonding intensified by supernatural nature.\n\n[⚙️ GRACE INHERITANCE]\n- Angelic parent determines domain specialty (healing, warding, sight) and signature weakness; consistent across setting.\n\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Miracle Spike (brief divine boost), Ward-Step (slip through barriers), Aura Flare (stun/comfort cone).\n\n[🔮 DIVINE TELLS]\n- Sigil-like birthmarks, eye-shine during prayer, voice resonance on hymns; visible to those with supernatural sight.\n\n[⚠️ WEAKNESSES]\n- Grace-damping wards nullify abilities; heavy use causes tremors and light-sickness; mortal body limits divine power.\n\n[⛓️ COUNTERS]\n- Use grace-damping circles, force into fatigue where surges fail, exploit mortal body limitations.\n\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN\n- Pale blue with faint sigils appearing from certain angles.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":3,"position":1,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":5,"groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"case_sensitive":false,"displayIndex":6,"enabled":true,"extensions":{"addMemo":true,"characterFilter":null,"depth":5,"displayIndex":6,"excludeRecursion":true,"useProbability":true,"weight":10},"id":2,"insertion_order":3,"keys":["Species","species","fantasy species","race","fantasy race"],"name":"","priority":10,"secondary_keys":[],"triggers":[],"ignoreBudget":false,"group":"","characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"7":{"uid":7,"key":["<VALKYRIE>","<SPECIES:VALKYRIE>","<CHOOSER_OF_THE_SLAIN>","<BATTLE_MAIDEN>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"🛡️ Valkyrie — Chooser of the Slain","content":"🃏 VALKYRIE CARD\n★★★★☆ | War/Soul\n\n[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: Brunnhilde — the Valkyrie\n\"On your feet.\"\n\n[♀️ FEMALE-ONLY SPECIES]\n- Valkyries are exclusively female warrior-spirits; no male valkyries exist in traditional mythology. Reproduction occurs through divine mandate or union with worthy mortal heroes, producing daughters who may inherit the calling.\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n- Lifespan: immortal warrior-spirits bound to battlefield duties and soul collection.\n- Body: warrior physique optimized for aerial combat; wings or spirit-steeds for transport; high-altitude physiology.\n- Senses: see death threads and moment of worthy demise; detect honor and cowardice in battle.\n- Diet & Metabolism: sustained by worthy deaths and battlefield valor; feast hall mead enhances abilities.\n- Thermoregulation: cold-adapted for high altitude flight; stable heart rate in freezing conditions.\n- Healing: combat injuries heal through battlefield glory; non-combat wounds require traditional methods.\n- Reproduction: rare and usually tied to heroic bloodlines; offspring may inherit soul-sight abilities.\n- Sleep: short rest cycles between battle sorties; alert sleep listening for worthy deaths.\n- Habitat: battlefields, feast halls, mountain peaks, anywhere warriors prove their worth.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: relationships often form with worthy warriors; attracted to courage, honor, and martial prowess rather than physical traits alone.\n- Courtship: demonstrated valor in battle, protection of innocents, honorable conduct; sharing war stories and tactical knowledge; formal warrior respect rituals.\n- Mechanics: intense, passionate encounters often following battles; partners feel inspired and blessed; sexual energy tied to warrior spirit and battle-fury.\n- Arousal: triggered by displays of courage and honor; both partners experience heightened warrior instincts; spiritual connection through shared combat experience.\n- Fluids: standard production with possible blessing properties; offspring may inherit supernatural warrior traits.\n- Aftercare: weapon maintenance together, sharing battle plans, tending combat wounds;

diving spear attacks; shield-wall coordination from above.\n\n[⚡ SPECIAL MOVES]\n- Spear Stoop (diving strike), Soul-Call (pull marked warriors), Shieldwall Uplift (fortify battle line).\n\n[⚠️ WEAKNESSES]\n- Bound by honor codes limiting tactical options; cannot collect unworthy souls; vulnerable during low-altitude combat.\n\n[⛓️ COUNTERS]\n- Fight under low ceilings, ward the dying against collection rites, break sightlines to sever soul-call.\n\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION — VALKYRIE vs HARPY]\n- Valkyries are honorable warrior-spirits who collect worthy souls for divine feast halls through aerial combat;

excess divine force vents as light, heat, or sound; superior physical capabilities.\n- Senses: divine heritage grants supernatural perception related to parent domain; see through illusions and divine workings.\n- Diet & Metabolism: enhanced mortal needs; high lactic threshold; heals faster when performing domain-aligned acts.\n- Thermoregulation: resistant to environmental extremes related to divine parent's domain.\n- Healing: accelerated recovery especially from injuries gained in heroic acts; some wounds may leave divine scars.\n- Reproduction: fertile with mortals and supernatural beings; offspring may inherit diluted divine spark.\n- Sleep: prophetic dreams and divine omens; lack of sleep brings contradictory divine signs.\n- Habitat: wherever great deeds are needed; drawn to challenges matching their divine heritage.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: intense sexuality reflecting divine heritage; partners often feel blessed or transformed by contact; attraction frequently tied to shared heroic ideals.\n- Courtship: grand romantic gestures, heroic deeds performed for beloved, divine gift-giving; relationships often have mythic significance and attract divine attention.\n- Mechanics: divine spark enhances physical prowess and emotional intensity; partners may temporarily gain enhanced abilities or divine insights; overwhelming divine presence possible.\n- Arousal: divine heritage intensifies all sensations; partners feel connection to divine realm; possible manifestation of domain-related phenomena during climax.\n- Fluids: enhanced potency with possible divine properties;

see corruption and despair more clearly than hope.\n- Diet & Metabolism: sustains by draining hope or faith nearby; former divine sustenance now causes pain.\n- Thermoregulation: cold aura emanates constantly; comfortable in darkness and shadow.\n- Healing: recovers by absorbing despair; relic exposure from former choir slows regeneration significantly.\n- Reproduction: rare; offspring typically inherit corrupted grace and conflicted nature.\n- Sleep: uneasy stillness; feathers shed as dark dust during torpor; haunted by memories of former grace.\n- Habitat: abandoned churches, shadow realms, anywhere hope has died; avoid consecrated spaces.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: protective, intense sexuality focused on guarding chosen few; relationships become obsessive sanctuaries against divine rejection.\n- Courtship: quiet demonstrations of protection, sharing painful truths, wing-shelter from harsh world; partners become their new sacred purpose replacing broken divine vows.\n- Mechanics: sex under wing canopy creates private shadow realm;
