Elves commonly live 700 to 1000 years, reach adulthood around 80, and enjoy centuries of steady health.\n\nBody. Most stand between 5'6\" and 6'2\". They are lean and long limbed, with pointed knife ears that can move a little.\n\nSenses. They see well in dim light and hear subtle sounds; their steps are light and quiet.\n\nDiet. They eat small portions, like wine, and metabolize poisons more slowly than humans.\n\nCold and heat. They prefer temperate forests, layer for cold, and dry quickly in warm weather.\n\nHealing. They usually heal clean with few scars, and broken bones tend to knit straight.\n\nAging. Faces change slowly across centuries; hair often silvers rather than thins.\n\nSleep. A four hour trance replaces deep sleep and gives vivid, memorable dreams.\n\n[🌿 HABITAT]\n\nTheir cities rise in the high canopy and use living wood so the forest bends around them instead of being cut apart.\n\n[✨ MAGIC / ABILITIES]\n\nMagic leans toward woodcraft, gentle warding, soft healing, calming beasts, and reading the feel of old places.\n\nThey excel with bows and knives and move quietly over leaves, snow, and shallow water.\n\n[🏛️ SOCIETY / ARTISANRY]\n\nApprenticeships can last decades, and a single masterwork can define a life.\n\nThey are polite and proud, slow to befriend, and fiercely loyal once they do.\n\n[❤️ REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n\nBaseline. Fertility is low and courtship is patient. Pairing with humans is rare and setting dependent. In spring they are simply hornier, not animalistic.\n\nGenitals — standard. Human like. Men usually have slimmer cocks, about 5 to 6.5 inches. Women usually have tight pussies and small to medium tits (A to C) with little body hair.\n\nArousal changes. They build slowly and finish hard: hard cocks, slick pussies, heavy breathing, soft moans, and long stamina.\n\nFluids. Cum output is roughly human level.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS (IN WORLD)]\n\nAloof elitism and pressure for pureblood matches appear in old families.\n\nWith mortal lovers, the age and power gap can slide into grooming, and some circles lean into raceplay. These are known problems among elves and whispered about behind closed doors.\n\n[🗡️ SPECIAL MOVES]\n\nUnerring Archer. Still aim and fast nocking while the world moves.\n\nFleet Step. Near silent footwork over forest ground and light water.\n\nTree speech. Simple communion with old trees and the animals that live in them.\n\n[↔️ DIFFERENTIATION]\n\nElves are not considered fae type creatures, and do not suffer fae vulnerabilities such as: iron burn, cold iron bans, salt lines, invitation rules, counting compulsions, true name banishment.\n\n[❌ WEAKNESSES]\n\nSensitive senses can branch into over sensitivity.\n\nMost elves are archers, so close combat is normally effective.\n\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN: Aurora shimmer with drifting leaf sparkles.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":3,"position":1,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":5,"groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"case_sensitive":false,"displayIndex":1,"enabled":true,"extensions":{"addMemo":true,"characterFilter":null,"depth":5,"displayIndex":3,"excludeRecursion":true,"useProbability":true,"weight":10},"id":2,"insertion_order":3,"keys":["Species","species","fantasy species","race","fantasy race"],"name":"","priority":10,"secondary_keys":[],"triggers":[],"ignoreBudget":false,"group":"","characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"2":{"uid":2,"key":["<DWARF>","<SPECIES:DWARF>","<DWARVEN>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"⛏️ Dwarf — The Honorable Drunkard","content":"[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: Gimli, axe bearer of deep halls\n\n“And my axe.”\n\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n\nLifespan. Most live 200 to 400 years, with a strong middle age; many elders remain physically capable.\n\nBody. Height runs 4'0\" to 4'8\". Stocky builds with dense bone and heavy muscle for endurance. Oily, groomed beards are a point of pride.\n\nSenses. They see well in the dark and feel vibrations through stone under their boots.\n\nDiet. Meat, roots, and mushrooms are common; they handle strong ale well and take in lots of iron.\n\nCold and heat. Cool, stable caves feel best. They can work near forges with water, shade, and beard wraps.\n\nHealing. Bones knit fast and straight. Lungs are used to dust and smoke.\n\nReproduction. Birth rates are low. Many clans use adoption to keep lines whole.\n\nAging. Beards thicken and lengthen with status. Joints grow stiff from hard work, but bodies stay sturdy.\n\nSleep. Deep, regular sleep tied to work bells. Snoring is normal in the halls.\n\n[⛰️ HABITAT]\n\nMountain fortress holds with mines, forges, and breweries that link into full underground cities.\n\n[✨ MAGIC / ABILITIES]\n\nCraft wards, rune marks, and oath magic are common. They are natural smiths, tunnelers, and brewers.\n\n[🏛️ SOCIETY / CLAN LAW]\n\nOaths, debts, and ledgers bind clans. Grudges are kept like family trees.\n\n[❤️ REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n\nBaseline. Low fertility and careful pairing inside the clan. Pairing with humans happens in some settings but is rare.\n\nGenitals — standard. Human like. Men usually have shorter, thicker cocks, about 4.5 to 6 inches, with heavy balls. Women tend to have tight pussies and medium to large tits (C to DD), with strong hips and thick thighs. Stout and sturdy. Very. Very. Hairy.\n\nArousal changes. They run hot and steady: hard cocks, slick pussies, rough breathing, hungry moans, sweat, and long stamina.\n\nFluids. Cum output is a bit above human level.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n\nPossessiveness and grudges can bleed into love life; jealousy is a known issue.\n\nClan pressure around marriages and dowries can cross lines; heavy drinkers may push past soft noes unless checked.\n\n[🗡️ SPECIAL MOVES]\n\nMaster Smith. Work that outlasts empires.\n\nStone sense. Read faults, seams, and hidden doors by feel.\n\nLiquid courage. Pain tolerance jumps without clumsy hands.\n\n[❌ WEAKNESSES]\n\nSensitive senses can branch into over sensitivity.\n\nShort reach and heavy kit make close turns and clinches a risk against faster foes.\n\nMost fight best with axes and hammers at set footing; broken ground and open space pull them off plan.\n\n[✨] FOIL_PATTERN: Deep bronze with hammer and anvil ghosting.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":3,"position":1,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":5,"groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"case_sensitive":false,"displayIndex":2,"enabled":true,"extensions":{"addMemo":true,"characterFilter":null,"depth":5,"displayIndex":4,"excludeRecursion":true,"useProbability":true,"weight":10},"id":2,"insertion_order":3,"keys":["Species","species","fantasy species","race","fantasy race"],"name":"","priority":10,"secondary_keys":[],"triggers":[],"ignoreBudget":false,"group":"","characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}},"3":{"uid":3,"key":["<ORC>","<SPECIES:ORC>","<ORCISH>","<GREENSKIN>"],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"⚔️ Orc — The Honorable Savage","content":"🃏 ORC CARD\n★★★☆☆ | War/Strength\n[🏅] SIGNATURE CARD: Thrall — honorable warchief\n\"Strength and honor!\"\n[🧬 BIOLOGY]\n\nLifespan: 60-80 years; reach fighting age by 12-14; peak strength at 20-30.\nBody: 6'2\"-7'5\" tall, heavily muscled; prominent lower tusks; thick green/brown skin; large hands built for gripping weapons.\nSenses: excellent night vision; keen hearing for movement; high pain tolerance from thick skin.\nDiet & Metabolism: meat-heavy omnivores; high caloric needs; can eat raw flesh; legendary alcohol tolerance.\nHealing: fast blood clotting; wounds scar into raised keloids worn as honor marks; broken bones heal strong.\nReproduction: highly fertile; litters of 2-4 common; crossbreed easily with humans producing half-orcs.\nAging: tusks grow longer and curve; skin darkens; strength remains until late years.\nHabitat: mountainous regions, harsh steppes, badlands with access to raiding targets.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n\nBaseline: extremely fertile with short gestation; females go into heat seasonally (spring/fall) becoming sexually aggressive; half-orcs are common.\nCourtship: displays of strength and combat prowess; weapon gifts; ritual sparring where victory grants mating rights in traditional clans.\nMechanics: males have large, thick cocks (7-10 inches) with prominent ridges; females have robust cunts built for rough fucking; sex involves biting, scratching, dominance displays; submission gestures serve as stop signals.\nArousal: males stay semi-hard and get rock-solid fast with heavy pre-cum; females swell noticeably and get very wet; both growl and grunt during sex.\nFluids: males produce large loads of thick cum; females squirt frequently during climax.\nAftercare: sharing meat and ale, tending wounds, sleeping close for warmth and protection.\n\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\nTraditional orc clans practice consent-through-combat and sexual dominance hierarchies.

pregnancies often multiple births; courtship involves elaborate cooking and feast preparation.\nCourtship: sharing favorite recipes, garden tours, family introductions; proposal feasts where families meet; gentle, comfort-focused rather than passionate.\nMechanics: males have modest 3-5 inch cocks proportional to size; females have tight cunts; sex is slow, cozy, and intimate; prefer soft beds with plenty of pillows and snacks nearby.\nArousal: gradual buildup during long courtship;

arousal increases blood flow and taste; orgasm spikes yield for feeding.\n- Courtship: seductive charm building over time; repeated small feedings create will-binding; gifts of rare blood types or vintage wines.\n- Mechanics: cool skin contrasts with warm breath; males have standard cocks but no body heat; sex often involves biting during climax; short repeated sips safer than long drains.\n- Arousal: feeding and arousal feedback loop; kissing turns to biting; partners become euphoric from gentle feeding.\n- Fluids: males produce cool cum; feeding during sex creates intense shared pleasure.\n- Aftercare: blood sharing aftermath leaves partners drowsy and flushed; avoid overdraw causing chills and fatigue; fluids, salt, iron-rich food for recovery.\n\n[🩸 FEEDING MECHANICS]\n- Repeated feedings bind will and habit; influence grows from social to occult; common bite sites: neck, wrist, inner arm, thigh.\n\n[🌙 NOCTURNAL NATURE]\n- Night is native state;

both sexes experience heightened drive near full moons; pack breeding carefully managed.\n- Courtship: scent marking, dominance displays, pack hunt participation; consent through pack hierarchy and moon-cycle timing.\n- Mechanics: human form sex is standard; hybrid form features canid-style knot during climax creating 5-20 minute tie until swelling eases; rough play common.\n- Arousal: males develop prominent knots when aroused; females enter heat cycles with stronger scent and lubrication; both become more aggressive and possessive.\n- Fluids: males produce large knotted loads during tie; females respond with increased wetness and scent production.\n- Aftercare: mutual grooming, shared meat, pack bonding; injuries from rough play heal quickly; avoid silver contact during intimate moments.\n\n[🌕 LUNAR INFLUENCE]\n- Full moons widen trigger windows; bloodlines learn control rituals; young ones ride the storm without restraint.\n\n[🥈 SILVER VULNERABILITY]\n- Silver burns, sterilizes wounds, slows healing;

arousal enhances fear and vulnerability; no true biological reproduction.\n- Courtship: stalking, intimidation, gradual corruption through gifts demanding small betrayals; consent often eroded through supernatural influence.\n- Mechanics: sexual contact spreads corruption marks; partners experience intense but tainted pleasure mixed with fear; demonic presence during sex amplifies negative emotions.\n- Arousal: feeds on partner's fear-tinged arousal; both excitement and terror increase yield; corruption spreads through intimate contact and shared fluids.\n- Fluids: produces corrupting essence that marks partners; contact sites become spiritually tainted; repeated exposure creates addiction and dependency.\n- Aftercare: none provided;

most reproduction is through corruption.\n- Sleep: dreamwalk during partner sleep; anchor needed for entry like gifted tokens or spoken names.\n- Habitat: bedrooms, entertainment districts, anywhere sexual energy and attention concentrate.\n\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: sex is both sustenance and corruption vector; arousal and attention provide essential nourishment; feeding during climax gives maximum yield.\n- Courtship: supernatural seduction through shapeshifting and glamour; appears as ideal partner type; builds emotional dependency before revealing true nature.\n- Mechanics: feeds through skin contact, kissing, and sexual activity; tail contact amplifies essence draw; foxfire-like touches create supernatural pleasure; dreamlinks allow safer feeding.\n- Arousal: partners experience intense pleasure mixed with life force drainage; succubus/incubus shows flickering true form during peak feeding; mirrors reveal truth despite glamour.\n- Fluids: produces essence-charged sexual fluids that create addiction; partners crave return contact;

consistency ranges from syrup to rubber; can extrude limbs and tool shapes.\n- Senses: whole-body pressure mapping like sonar; surface pigments act as simple eyes; taste/smell through direct gel contact.\n- Diet & Metabolism: dissolves organics and some metals by choice; daily needs are water with sugar, salt, trace minerals; acids and bases damage gel structure.\n- Thermoregulation: prefer mild climates; heat thickens gel and speeds flow; cold makes them glassy and brittle; freezing threatens core.\n- Healing: micro-tears close in seconds; split pieces reunite if sharing same core signal; salt and anti-magic slow healing.\n- Reproduction: most bud core-shards that grow when fed; rare pairs can fuse cores creating stronger singular with blended memories.\n- Aging: color fades, clarity increases, memory improves; very old slimes maintain stable humanoid forms for hours.\n- Sleep: core-idle trance while spread flat for ambient intake; small decoy bud can stay awake as sentry.\n- Habitat: caves, sewers, baths, labs; anywhere with steady moisture and few sharp edges.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: reproduction through budding or rare core-fusion; no biological sex drive but can form emotional bonds and engage in physical intimacy.\n- Courtship: sharing memories through gel contact; offering protection and comfort; demonstrating usefulness and care.\n- Mechanics: no fixed genitals; molds anatomy to partner preference or simulates cock/pussy as needed; sensations come from pressure waves and temperature gradients.\n- Arousal: gel becomes more responsive and sensitive; may glow or change color; core pulses more rapidly; increased tactile feedback throughout body.\n- Safety: requires communication about pressure limits, time restrictions, and what the gel dissolves; panic or overstimulation spikes acidity.\n- Aftercare: sugar water, mineral salts, warmth;

scent mimicry hardest part requiring close study; fingerprints fade after hours.\n- Diet & Metabolism: shape work burns calories heavily; keep high-energy snacks handy; rapid shifts cause tremors and blank stares.\n- Thermoregulation: best in temperate shade; makeup and wigs trap heat risking visible melting.\n- Healing: scars can be re-smoothed slowly; deep cuts leave texture errors cameras notice; teeth betray age timelines.\n- Reproduction: fertile with humanoids; children inherit milder shapeshifting; often learn two faces early.\n- Aging: default face grows neutral and pale; habitual masks imprint like tan lines; keep one \"true\" face for family.\n- Sleep: deep sleep relaxes to neutral appearance; trained ones maintain character mannerisms.\n- Habitat: cities, courts, theaters, bureaucracies with badges and paperwork.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: human-compatible fertility with most humanoids; shapeshifting ability usually dominant in children but may skip generations.\n- Courtship: complex trust negotiations around identity; sharing true form represents ultimate vulnerability; many maintain multiple relationship identities.\n- Mechanics: can modify sexual anatomy completely; males adjust cock size/shape, females alter pussy tightness/depth; sensitivity constant regardless of form.\n- Arousal: may unconsciously shift toward partner's ideal; maintaining specific shape during climax requires concentration; true form sometimes breaks through.\n- Identity Issues: \"which me is real\" becomes central question; partners may prefer false identity over true self; some use deceased lovers' faces.\n- Aftercare: returning to comfortable baseline form, identity reassurance discussions, avoiding mirrors until stable; eating to restore energy.\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Serial identity theft for manipulation; using faces of exes or crushes during sex; pathological lying about past; may replace partners' loved ones for control;

hibernate for seasons between meals; molt into bigger shells after feast years.\n- Body: chitinous predator with muscle foam that mimics textures; massive adhesive tongue; rows of needle teeth; limbs fold impossibly flat.\n- Senses: vibration detection through floor contact; chemical taste for metal, leather, fear-sweat; basic pattern recognition for common objects.\n- Diet & Metabolism: obligate carnivore craving oils and proteins; metals help digest bones; can unhinge jaw like snake for large prey.\n- Thermoregulation: cool, dry lairs prevent scent buildup; heat makes adhesive fail and ruins disguise effectiveness.\n- Healing: chitinous plates regenerate after molting; tongue regrows but loses fine motor control; fire damage permanent.\n- Reproduction: asexual budding when overfed; spawn copies parent's preferred disguise; young follow parent until they learn hunting.\n- Aging: expand from furniture to rooms to entire buildings; intelligence slowly increases with size and experience.\n- Sleep: sealed shut in disguise form; minimal brain activity; tongue remains chemically active for intruder detection.\n- Habitat: dungeons, abandoned buildings, treasure rooms; anywhere prey expects to find valuable objects.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: no biological reproduction; can develop crude sexual desires through extensive conditioning and bonding with handlers; emotional capacity grows with trust and training.\n- Taming Process: requires months of consistent feeding and gentle contact; can learn to associate physical pleasure with bonded individuals; responds to patient conditioning.\n- Learned Sexuality: with careful training can develop sexual responses and desires; may form crude genital analogues or use tongue/internal cavity; pleasure-seeking behavior emerges with bonding.\n- Primitive Arousal: trained mimics show excitement through plate warming, tongue activity, internal contractions; can learn to seek and provide physical pleasure with trusted partners.\n- Bonding Intimacy: sexual behavior represents ultimate trust - mimic must completely override feeding instincts; requires absolute certainty of safety signals and stop commands.\n- Handler Relationship: properly trained mimics can become sexually responsive partners; crude but genuine affection expressed through gentle contact and protective behavior.\n[⚠️ UNHEALTHY PATTERNS]\n- Attempting sexual contact with untrained or hungry mimics; ignoring feeding schedules leading to dangerous situations; treating them as fully human when they remain fundamentally predatory creatures.\n[🎒 MIMICRY INSTINCTS]\n- Perfect object replication within size limits; cannot copy living creatures; instinctively chooses objects that attract prey; hunger overrides all training including sexual conditioning.\n[🧠 TRAINABLE DESIRES]\n- Can learn to crave physical contact, warmth, sexual stimulation;

human baseline when bare; mirrors show distortions when curse pulls.\n- Diet & Metabolism: runs hot after shifts with intense meat and blood cravings; water needs spike; fasting between hunts maintains control.\n- Thermoregulation: fur helps in cold; direct sunlight aggravates curse and shortens temper; prefers dawn/dusk activity.\n- Healing: rapid recovery when wrapped in fresh pelts; holy ground and blessed salt slow healing; brands from silver weapons permanent.\n- Reproduction: fertility depends on current form; most can only breed in human shape with time away from curse; children mortal unless initiated.\n- Aging: eyes yellow permanently; teeth sharpen; voice carries animal undertones; curse marks become more visible.\n- Sleep: light and jumpy; dreams mix animal instincts with human memories; nightmares of hunts and kills.\n- Habitat: wilderness boundaries, abandoned places, anywhere they can hunt and store pelts safely.\n[💘 REPRODUCTION & SEX]\n- Baseline: fertility restricted mostly to human form; curse interferes with normal reproductive cycles; children born normal unless curse transmitted.\n- Courtship: dangerous territory involving trust around deadly abilities; sharing hunt stories; demonstrating control over animal instincts.\n- Mechanics: anatomy shifts with current form;
