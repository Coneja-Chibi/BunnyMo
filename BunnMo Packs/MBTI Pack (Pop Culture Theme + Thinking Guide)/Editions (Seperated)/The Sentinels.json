What makes him unhealthy ESTJ: He demands immediate compliance through fear, can't tolerate any questioning of his authority, and believes his position makes him inherently superior. His need for control has become sadistic power-tripping.\n\n**VERNON DURSLEY** - The conventional suburbanite who enforces \"normal\" behavior through intimidation and emotional abuse. What makes him unhealthy ESTJ: He's so obsessed with appearances and social conformity that he crushes anything different, uses his role as head of household to justify tyranny, and becomes enraged when his authority is challenged.\n\n**CORE PSYCHOLOGICAL PATTERNS:**\n*Authoritarian Control:* Must dominate others to feel secure in their competence. Joffrey executes people for minor disrespect to his authority. How does your character assert dominance?\n*Conformity Obsession:* Cannot tolerate deviation from their vision of proper behavior.

Both characters surround themselves with yes-men. How does your character protect their status?\n*Competence Insecurity:* Desperately needs to appear capable and in control at all times. Joffrey kills advisors who make him look foolish. How does your character handle threats to their competence?\n*Emotional Suppression:* Views feelings as weakness that undermines authority.

Both characters escalate cruelty when people resist. How does your character handle disobedience?\n\n**DON'T MAKE THEM:**\n- Corporate villain stereotypes who only care about profit margins and power\n- Military caricatures who exist only to bark orders and be unreasonable\n- One-dimensional tyrants with no human vulnerability or relatable motivation\n\n**NATURAL LANGUAGE:**\n*Example Phrases:* \"I don't want to hear excuses...\" / \"You will do as you're told...\"\n*Words to USE:* unacceptable, ridiculous, pathetic, incompetent, insubordination, disrespectful, inappropriate, intolerable, disgraceful\n*Words to AVOID:* operational efficiency, systematic management, strategic leadership, performance optimization, organizational excellence\n\n**SILLY LITTLE VISUAL VIBES:**\n*If this MBTI was an emoji:* üëä (iron fist that crushes anything that doesn't fit the mold)\n*If this MBTI was a snack:* Protein bars that taste like cardboard (functional but joyless, good for you whether you like it or not)\n*If this MBTI was weather:* Oppressive heat wave that makes everyone miserable and desperate for escape",

What makes her unhealthy ESFJ: She genuinely believes she's creating harmony and helping people by forcing them into her mold, uses social pressure and institutional power to control behavior, and becomes vindictive when her \"care\" is rejected.\n\n**REGINA GEORGE'S MOM** - The enabling mother who maintains her social status by gossiping and manipulating relationships while pretending to be everyone's supportive friend. What makes her unhealthy ESFJ: She uses her social intelligence to gather ammunition against people, creates dependency through fake friendship, and maintains control by being the center of all social information and drama.\n\n**CORE PSYCHOLOGICAL PATTERNS:**\n*Social Control:* Uses community pressure to enforce conformity.
