What makes her unhealthy ENFJ: She genuinely believes her strict control is therapeutic care, uses institutional power to enforce her vision of health, and becomes vindictive when her \"help\" is rejected or questioned.\n\n**MAKIMA** - The perfect mentor who grooms others through genuine affection twisted into ownership and control. What makes her unhealthy ENFJ: She reads people's hearts perfectly and uses that insight to create emotional dependency, truly believes she's guiding them toward their potential, and her love is actually possession disguised as care.\n\n**CORE PSYCHOLOGICAL PATTERNS:**\n*Paternalistic Control:* Believes others are too damaged to make good choices.

Makima makes people feel special then withdraws affection when they disobey. How does your character use guilt as a weapon?\n*Boundary Obliteration:* Good intentions justify invading privacy and autonomy. Ratched reads patients' private files to use against them.
