# 🥕✨Bunnymo: Advanced AI Roleplay Framework✨🥕

**Status: Work in Progress 🛠️ | Testing Welcome** 🧪

## 🐰 What the Hell is Bunnymo?

Bunnymo aims to turn your basic character cards into psychologically authentic, adult-oriented roleplay experiences. Instead of shallow interactions, the goal is characters with depth, realistic emotional patterns, and natural relationship dynamics.

Think of it as the difference between a cardboard cutout and a real person who happens to live in your chat. 💭

## 🛠️ How It Works Together

### 🧠 The Core System (Required)
The main Bunnymo lorebook is your foundation. Without this, nothing else functions properly.

We've made a bunch of different entries in different styles to give the AI more specific references. While AI can be very smart, at the end of the day it can need a lot of handholding to avoid specific and constant bad behaviors (when I get my hands on you, CLANKERS 🤖💢)

### 🎁 The Packs (Optional Add-ons)
We've been busy little bunnies releasing themed content:
- **🌸 Dere Pack**: We dropped a whole gaming pass loaded with romantic personality archetypes as playable characters
- **🧩 MBTI Pack**: Released a personality magazine complete with quirky quizzes comparing types to snacks and weather
- **👾 Species Pack**: Created an entire trading card game featuring 80+ fantasy species with full stat blocks

These packs help break the AI out of its boring default thinking patterns! 🌈✨ Instead of falling back on the same tired references, it gets weird new frames to work with - making it read between the lines and draw fresh comparisons to gaming mechanics, magazine quizzes, and card collections.

*More releases coming soon!* 📦

## 🏷️ Advanced Tagging System
Characters get comprehensive psychological profiles using standardized tags. As of right now only some tags have working repositories, but as BunnyMo is a massive project, more are being worked on every day! 

**Example tags:**
```
<BunnymoTags>Alice: <SPECIES:Human>, <DERE:Tsundere>, <ATTACHMENT:Anxious>, 
<KINK:Service_Sub>, <SEXY:SUB>, <TRAIT:Perfectionist>, <MBTI:ESFJ-U></BunnymoTags>
```

## 📋 Analysis Command
- `!fullsheet` - Generates complete psychological analysis and character tags

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

1. **🧠 Install the Core**: Download and add the main Bunnymo lorebook to your AI system
2. **🎁 Choose Your Packs**: Add whichever expansion packs match your interests  
3. **💬 Build Context**: RP with your characters for 20+ messages so they adapt to you. (Perfume out the bottle smells different than it does on your skin.) 
4. **📊 Run Analysis**: Use `!fullsheet` to generate complete character analysis and tags
5. **📂 Archive Results**: You have two options:
   - **5A (Token Efficient)**: Copy only the tags into the Character Archives section, set the entry keys to character names/titles so it activates when they're present
   - **5B (Token Heavy)**: Copy the entire sheet into Character Archives if you want the AI to have more detailed analysis
   
   **Note**: If characters are main characters who come up a lot, set them as "constant", otherwise leave at "normal" (applies to both options)

## ⚙️ Recommended Settings
- **Output Token Cap**: 13k+ when triggering the !fullsheet command (the analysis is comprehensive!) 🔢

## 🔧 Common Issues

**"The sheet cut off!"** 😤  
Make sure your token output limits are high enough (around 13k) for it to generate. Otherwise, get gemini'd lmao.

**"!fullsheet isn't running!"** 😭  
Try prefacing your ask exactly like this: `(OOC: PAUSE THE RP AND RUN !FULLSHEET AS DIRECTED.)`  
If that still doesn't work, try using Guided Generations.

## 🌟 What Makes This Different

This lorebook is intended to be a preset that fires automatically and intelligently using the worldbook settings and activations to our advantage! I've heard good things with all major AI models (however it's still a WIP so don't bite my head off if it bugs and triggers a lot of tokens and you're using Claude 😅). While this is a massive undertaking, it's still in progress, so if you see something: Say something! 🗣️

## 🧪 Testing & Feedback

This system is actively being refined by several bunnies in a trenchcoat (don't ask). If you try it:
- Report what works and what breaks 🐛
- Share interesting character developments 📈
- Suggest improvements to existing frameworks 💡
- Test edge cases and unusual scenarios 🎭

The goal is creating what aims to be the most psychologically authentic AI roleplay experience possible. Your feedback helps make that happen! 🙏

## 🎉 Special Thanks

## 🥕 About the Development Team

This project is *definitely* made by a single, normal human developer and not five bunnies stacked in a trenchcoat pretending to understand code. Any reports of mysterious carrot crumbs in the documentation or inexplicably cute variable names are purely coincidental. The development team asks that you do not look behind the curtain, especially if you hear suspicious munching sounds. 

-# *All inquiries about the nature of our existence should be directed to /dev/null. 🐰🧥✨*

Also, NemoVonNirgend, amazing creator of the Vex preset (and great friend) helps ~~us~~ me make and refine this! He also inspired me to create this. Give him a round of pa-... Hands...

*We are absolutely not bunnies. Please do not bring lettuce to any meetups.*

Thanks for reading!
